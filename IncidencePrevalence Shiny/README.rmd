# IncidencePrevalence Shiny

This step is optional if you want to look at your results before sending them back to us. This code contains a shiny to view your results from the IncidencePrevalence Code 

## Instructions

You have already pulled the update from the repository which means that this Shiny project is already part of your R environment.

However, the renv lock for the shiny is different from the renv for the Code. Therefore you have to run the following command in the console to install all R packages in the right version.

```{r}
renv::activate()
renv::restore()
```

Please create a "data" folder on the same level as the .Rproj and put the following three csv files into it (or multiples if you have several databases): “snapshot_"dbName”.csv, “dbName”_Incidence.csv, “dbName”_Prevalence.csv, "incidence_attrition_dbName”.csv, and "prevalence_attrition_dbName”.csv. You can also put folders into the “data” folder with the csv’s therein, the code will look for the files also in sub-directories, but not zip files.

Then open global.R and click "Run App" in the top right corner.
