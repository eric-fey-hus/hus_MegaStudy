# IncidencePrevalence Shiny

This code contains a shiny to view your results from the
IncidencePrevalence Code. This step is for you want to look at your
results before sending them back to us and to double check whether the
results make sense.

## Instructions

You have already pulled the update from the repository which means that
this Shiny project is already part of your R environment.

However, the renv lock for the shiny is different from the renv for the
Code. Therefore you have to run the following command in the console to
install all R packages in the right version.

``` r
renv::activate()
renv::restore()
```


Please create a “data” folder on the same level as the .Rproj into which
you upload your zip file: Results\_“dbName”.zip. RStudio automatically
unzips the files ending up in the “data” folder. Please double check. In
the end, your “data” folder should contain: snapshot\_“dbName”.csv,
“dbName_IncidencePrevalenceResults.zip (yes, still a zip, that is good,
there was a zip in the zip and it will be taken care of in the shiny
code ;-)), incidence_attrition_dbName”.csv, and
prevalence_attrition\_“dbName”.csv. If you have several databases, you
will have several copies of those files each with a different “dbName”.

Then open global.R and click “Run App” in the top right corner.
